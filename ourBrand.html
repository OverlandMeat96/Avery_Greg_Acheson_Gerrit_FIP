					<p>Speed Orbiter's beer is crafted in London, Ontario and has had a quick start in 2020. It's a province where the flowing water and lush greenery has a distinct beauty, with distinctive culture and of course, exceptional beer. Wine country is where it's at but the beer that comes out of Ontario is top notch which also allows for unique flavours. Our inspiration has come from other successful Ontario breweries, We derived our flavours and values from the history of Alexander Keith's and take the management styles of Puma for a successful dynamic duo.</p>

							<h5>History</h5>
							<p>Speed Orbiter is a​ brewery​ in​ London Ontario, Canada. It is part of Anheuser-Busch InBev​, a holdings company based in​ Leuven​, Belgium. The brewery was founded in 2020 by​ Greg Avery and Gerrit Acheson​ who had purchased a lottery ticket and bought out the old Alexander Keith's brand. They decided to use the rest of the money to purchase the Puma brand as well a create a mashup. In partnership with Labatt Breweries the Speed Orbiter Beer was born. The Speed Orbiter Pale Ale​ (IPA) is just getting started but is already breaking records with sales. The beer is on target to being the most popular beer in North America and soon the world.</p>
